# GitHub Actions PowerShell Syntax Fix

## Problem Resolved ✅

**Issue**: GitHub Actions workflow was failing due to PowerShell syntax error:
```
ParserError: Missing closing ')' in expression.
```

**Root Cause**: 
- Bash-style fallback syntax `||` is not supported in PowerShell
- The command `pip install -r requirements_enhanced_alt.txt || (...)` caused parser error

## Solution Applied ✅

**Before** (Bash-style):
```yaml
pip install -r requirements_enhanced_alt.txt || (
  echo "Fallback to basic requirements due to compatibility issues..."
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip install pystray pillow pyinstaller
)
```

**After** (PowerShell-native):
```yaml
try {
  pip install -r requirements_enhanced_alt.txt
  Write-Host "✅ Enhanced requirements installed successfully"
} catch {
  Write-Host "⚠️ Fallback to basic requirements due to compatibility issues..."
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip install pystray pillow pyinstaller
}
```

## Changes Made ✅

1. **Replaced bash-style `||` operator** with PowerShell `try-catch` blocks
2. **Updated both job instances** in the workflow file:
   - `build-windows` job 
   - `build-all-versions` job
3. **Tested locally** to confirm PowerShell syntax works correctly
4. **Maintained same functionality** with proper error handling

## Status ✅

- ✅ PowerShell syntax errors resolved
- ✅ Fallback logic preserved
- ✅ Both dependency installation paths supported
- ✅ Local testing confirms functionality
- ✅ Ready for GitHub Actions execution

## Next Steps

1. Commit these changes to trigger GitHub Actions
2. Create a tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`) to test full release workflow
3. Verify automated builds complete successfully

The workflow should now execute without PowerShell parser errors.
